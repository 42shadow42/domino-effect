# Rules of dominos

## Trigger
Triggers are the basic form of dominos they are read and write enabled. 
When changed they will trigger a domino effect and will cascade changes to dependent domnions.

<Canvas of={Trigger} />

## Domino
Dominos are derived from triggers, they exhibit the domino effect and will cascade changes to dependent dominos.

<Canvas of={Domino} />


## Multiple Dominos
Prior to react 18.3.0 it was necessary to limit domino usage to a single domino per component.
Due to the release of the use hook in 18.3.0 this limitation has been lifted, and the rules required Splitting Components or Combining Dominos no longer apply.

## Select only what you need
When dealing with complex objects dominos can cause excessive rendering. 
To resolve rendering problems you can split using basic dominos and memoize components.

### Splitting Dominos

<Canvas of={SplittingDominos} />

This works with async dominos too! 
Just keep in mind async operations will still be performed if they depend directly on changed values.

## Caching in Dominos

You can cache data in your dominos for expensive operations.
Just keep in mind to expire data, that may get stale.

### Multiple values
You can use a single domino for multiple values either by providing a context, or custom stores.

### Using Context with Dominos

You can pass primitives to access contextual values.
This allows you to use local state to pick an instance.

### Custom Stores for Dominos

You can pass the stores via context to prevent prop drilling.
To create a store local to your components use useLocalStore, to avoid memory leaks.

### Manual Cleanup

Sometimes you create resources that must be cleaned up manual such as web socket connections.
You can do that using the onDelete callback when configured a sensitive domino.
Keep in mind the onDelete callback will never be called without a ttl configured as well.

### Refreshing

Sometimes you want to manually refresh dominos.
For example maybe your domino is a counter that you'd like to reset.
Or possibly your domino is a remote resource that has been modified and needs refreshed.
