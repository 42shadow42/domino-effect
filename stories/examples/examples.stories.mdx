# Examples

## NPM Registry

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.NPMRegistry} />
</Canvas>

## Chat Server

The chat server depends on an underlying web service, and won't function in GH Pages at present.
To see it working you can download the code and run the commands `npm run start-server` and `npm run storybook` in separate terminals.

  <Story story={stories.ChatServer} />
